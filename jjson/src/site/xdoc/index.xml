        <section name="JJSON - A JSON Library for Java without dependencies">
            <p>JJSon is a simple API for dealing with the JSON format. It needs no dependencies and just offers the 
                features you really need to work. You can find the JSON Specification there: http://www.json.org
            </p>
  
            <p>Currently JJSON does not need any dependency - it's planned that it will not need any dependencies in the future.</p> 
  
            <p>In addition there is some space for framework plugins which use this api. At the moment there is a 
                Struts 2 plugin available, which can be used as a result type to return JSON Strings.
            </p>

        <section name="Features">
            <ul>
                <li>Using annotations to create json strings out of objects</li>
                <li>Map json strings into POJOs</li>
                <li>Creating a java object net out of a json string</li>
                <li>Creating a json string out of a java object net</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section name="Why another JSon-Lib for Java?">
            I just didn't want to have complex implementations of this simple notation- most of the features other libs gave to me i didn't use. If you feel the same you should consider to contact me (on the dev list) and contribute some patches. You are welcome.
        </section>

        <section name="State of development">
            <p>The new version should work for a lots of cases. Mapping with annotations and working with json using the apis objects work in both directions.</p>
            <p>The struts 2 plugin is pretty new and has the ususal flaws.</p>
